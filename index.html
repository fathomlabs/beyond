            <h3 class="header col s12 light">Fathom Beyond is an ethical tourism company, working in the Maasai Mara in Kenya. Our primary aim is to keep the profits of tourism in the hands of local Maasai communities, some of the poorest people in the world. We work with safari guides, scientists, and naturalists to provide a quality experience to tourists, whilst taking care of the natural world.</h3>

            <p class="left-align light">The Maasai Mara is perhaps the most famous and popular tourist destination in Kenya. It generates an estimated £13 million each year from its hundreds of thousands of visitors. However its local residents, the Maasai people, are some of the poorest in the world. One study found that 55% of adults in a Maasai tribe were wasted or underweight, and 36% of infants were stunted. Poverty is rife: around 70% of Maasai communities are poor despite investment in education and employment. Many tour operators are run by foreigners, and see local people only as cheap labour, offering them with only a tiny fraction of the proceeds. Existing eco-tourism efforts are investing in important initiatives, but many are failing to work with local people to build on the skills and entrepreneurship that is already present.</p>

              <p class="light">We will build an ethical safari experience in partnership with Maasai people who provide quality tours. We are a for-profit company, however we are also a social enterprise and our primary aim is to provide a fairer distribution of wealth. No one is currently drawing a salary from the company, and if this does happen, it will only be after we have a sustainable model that is making a positive social impact for Maasai communities. We have thought very carefully about how to analyse our social impact, and these ideas will be detailed in one of our first blog posts.</p>

              <p class="light">To begin with we wish to raise funds to purchase a safari vehicle. This is estimated to cost between £15,000 and £20,000. The proceeds from the vehicle rental, and any excess from fund-raising will be used for fuel, repairs, and maintenance. After these costs, any remaining revenue will be invested back into the company to buy our next vehicle. We hope to build up a fleet of cars so that we can share the proceeds of tourism with more local people. Investing in Fathom Beyond is a bit like giving to charity: our work will bring about positive social change. However instead of asking for more money for the same work in the future, we can show you how you have helped to build a self-sustaining business that will continue to do good.</p>

We believe that there are far more exciting things to see and experience than are currently on offer to tourists in Kenya. We will provide sci-faris, insect trails</p>
